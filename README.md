## Exploration of 2019 Wage Income in Minnesota by Data Visualizations

### Project Description

_Course_: **“Data Visualization”** offered by Udacity as part of their **Data Analyst Nanodegree** Program.

_Data_:  US Census microdata (43,143 entries) from the 2019 American Community Survey for Minnesota, obtained from [IPUMS USA](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/index.shtml).

_Project Tasks_:  

- Choose a data source and obtain the data.
- Explore the data using the “Question-Visualization-Observations” framework.
- Create at least 15 visualizations distributed over univariate, bivariate, and multivariate plots to explore relationships in the dataset.
- Create a [HTML slide deck presentation](https://brianallan.github.io/DataViz-MN2019-Wage-Income/Part_II_slide_deck.slides.html) with polished visualizations (using `jupyter nbconvert`) to communicate at least 3 key insights.
- Create a [summary report](https://brianallan.github.io/DataViz-MN2019-Wage-Income/summary_report.html), using markdown, that describes the dataset, summarizes the findings, and lists key insights for presentation.


Coding and documentation were done using `Python` in a Jupyter notebook to produce the [full project report](https://brianallan.github.io/DataViz-MN2019-Wage-Income/).
